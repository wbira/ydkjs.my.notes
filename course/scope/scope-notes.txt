    JIT
    Complier find declaration, and putting to apropiete scope.

    JavaScript engine perform smany of the same steps (like in traditional compiler)
    1. Tokenizig/lexing
    2. Parsing => stream of tokens is converted to tree of nested elements called Abstract Syntax tree
    3. Code-generation => process of taking an AST and turning it into executable code.

Javascript has lexical and dynamic scope
    There is no bridge between these two types of scopes
    TODO// more about differences
