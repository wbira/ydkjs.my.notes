/****** new keyword *******/

/*
Constructor in JS is just a normal function.
When function is invoked with kew keyword at the beginning, there are four things happening:

1. new object o is created
2. o is linked to the prototype
3. o is this for this function call
4. invoked function return o (unless function returns own alternate object)
